	<h3>Daydreaming welcomes us into a realm of freeflowing contemplation to connect random, intersecting thoughts inspired by the physical existence. This can introduce us to new ideas, random imagery, previous occurrances or back to reality. Although the concept of daydreaming revolves around fantasy and uncertain possibilities, my digital interpretation of daydreaming can emualte a real-life visual. As you click through, allow yourself to take time to also let your thoughts and idea drift away. </h3>
