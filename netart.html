	<h1>NET ART</h1>

	<h3 id="pageElements">Daydreaming welcomes us into a realm of free-flowing contemplation to connect random, intersecting thoughts inspired by the physical existence. This can introduce us to new ideas, random imagery, previous occurrences or back to reality. Although the concept of daydreaming revolves around fantasy and uncertain possibilities, my digital interpretation of daydreaming can emulate a real-life visual. As you click through, allow yourself to take time to also let your thoughts and idea drift away. </h3>
