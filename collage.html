	<h1>COLLAGE</h1>

	<h2> DIGITAL REMIX</h2>

	<h3 id="pageElements">The aspect of fragility in our governing state has become absent and disregarded. With negligence comes fear and anger among the governed. It seems that there is a wide range of absentmindedness for humaneness and compassion. Although I kept appropriation in mind for this collage, it’s not as recontextualized compared to the reality, because the reality is that this cheeto of a man has said this quote – and many more – and has negatively affected an abundance of people, specifically women in this context.
