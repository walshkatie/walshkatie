	<h2> TELLING A STORY</h2>

	<h3 id="pagevideo"> We each experience our own personal narratives when we wake up every morning. Every second is filled with a movement, some form of energy, something that is happening, even if itâ€™s miniscule. These small happenings connect our narratives and can go underappreciated. It is not possible to fully live in the present unless we slow down to observe and inhale. The Little Things is a narrative that expresses my personal accounts, but is also open to various interpretations, depending on the viewer.
